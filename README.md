## walk-a-desk (computerShapedAroundConversation)

(quick prototype nr.0; projector and cam on a broom stick, aiming at same area. Plus speaker and microphone.)

Why?
* Sitting whole day looking into a lamp is not healthy
* A phone/tablet screen is often too small and you 'lose' one hand holding it
* Information bandwidth is high for human communication including gestures, body language, tone, etc.
* A camera aimed at your face is not welcoming to many.
* In many situations people wouldn't be willing to put a VR/AR headsets on.
* Sketching with pencil, on papers you can reshuffle, is awesome for getting a train of thoughts accross quickly
* Different situations and ways of working allow for differently shaped combinations of devices
* I saw a cool, but massive, table with somewhat similar functionality: https://saxionoppad.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/digitale-discussietafel-oftewel-de-ipadtable/

What next?
* instead of rope, use a proper padded frame (similar to a marching band drum carrier)
* instead of the broom somewhat blocking one hand, the projector+cam will be hung on curve going overhead attached to frame on back
* construction can also be put on edge of table, and beamer and webcam can be rotated towards wall.
* more sensors can be added
* Add a no-hands-portable chair like https://www.lexbyastride.com/ ![a hands-free portable chair](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0554/7855/0722/products/Lex-wearable-bionic-chair-Yaksa-Red-Left-side_360x.jpg?v=1645345231)
* https://lampix.com/ might be part of this, or at least provide inspiration
The beamer can also be used to show what is in the field of the camera ...
That should actually be a component as such. To be put on this frame, but also hanging from the ceiling, or put on a headband.
Is the beamer fast enough for interlacing it with the camera?

Maybe a RECORD-mode can be triggered with a button on your wrist/knee/wherever, or a spoken command.

Cheaper, less-featured, not tried yet: a smartphone on 'harmonica holder'-like thing.
